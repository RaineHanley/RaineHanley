### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Raine (they/them) #Vegan #Activst #Queer
I am a fullstack Software Developer looking to collaborate, network, and create with others. 

I have worked in the field of Human Development for 12 years and recently made the switch to Software Development because I was ready for a new challenge. I realized that there was not a lot of room for me to grow or create in my previous field so, I came to the tech side and feel so much more fulfilled. 

I have my Bachelors of Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. Go Pack! 
During my studies, I was a part of an on campus group called NRAP(Nevada's Recovery and Prevention Community), had a group project selected to be a peer reviewed journal, and was always on the Dean's List.
